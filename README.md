PhoneGap/jQuery Mobile Hello World

This is a Hello Word for PhoneGap Build and jQuery Mobile. You can
create your own mobile app by following these simple steps:

1. Clone this repo. To use the free plan of PhoneGap Build you should
use public repos.
2. Edit `config.xml` and change at least `id` and `author`.
3. Create an Adobe ID in order to log in to PhoneGap Build
(https://build.phonegap.com).
4. Add new app to PhoneGap Build.
5. Give your git repo URL and click pull button.
6. Wait and you have a downloadable app.
